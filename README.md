Abstract for the study:

Background
Understanding the causal impacts of health on social and socioeconomic outcomes could demonstrate the potential broader benefits of investing in effective health policy, strengthening the case for cross-governmental action to improve health and its wider determinants at the population-level. 

Methods
We used Mendelian Randomization to estimate the effect of eight health conditions (asthma, breast cancer, coronary heart disease, depression, eczema, migraine, osteoarthritis, type 2 diabetes) and five health risk factors (alcohol intake, body mass index [BMI], cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, smoking) on 19 social and socioeconomic outcomes in 337,009 men and women of white British ancestry in UK Biobank, aged between 39 and 72 years. 

Findings
Results suggested that higher BMI, smoking and alcohol use adversely affect multiple socioeconomic outcomes. For example, smoking initiation was estimated to reduce household income (mean difference = -£24,394, 95% CI: -£33,403 to -£15,384), the chance of owning accommodation (absolute percentage change [APC] = -21·5%, 95% CI: -29·3% to -13·6%), being satisfied with health (APC = -32·4%, 95% CI: -48·9% to -15·8%), and of receiving a university degree (APC = -73·8%, 95% CI: -90·7% to -56·9%), and increase deprivation (mean difference in Townsend deprivation index = 1·89, 95% CI: 1·13 to 2·64). There was evidence that asthma increased deprivation and decreased household income and the chance of having a university degree, and migraine reduced the chance of having a weekly leisure or social activity, especially in men. For other associations, estimates were null, which may reflect true null associations, selection bias, and/or lack of power to detect effects.

Interpretation
Reducing average BMI levels, and further reducing smoking and alcohol intake, in addition to health benefits, may also improve socioeconomic outcomes for individuals and populations.
